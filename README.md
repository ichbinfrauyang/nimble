## A Chrome Extension for Crimson (Content Support Tool).

One of the general workflows for Content support engineers every day is to visit the Worksheet Space and click the tickets one by one.

Having an extension to extract and open those worksheets would make Content support engineersâ€™ job easier.

The Nimble Chrome Extension can open those worksheets for CEs in one go.
